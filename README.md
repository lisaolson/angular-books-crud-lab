# Summary

I had a really hard time getting the initial 'GET' method to render all of the books on the screen.  It was returning the object in the console, so I knew the function was successful, but I hard time finding it on the screen.  So that took me about two days to figure out where it was. However, once I got that figured out, the rest came pretty easily.  I feel pretty confident with the $http service syntax.  I had the hardest time with getting the successful functions to render on the page through the templates.
